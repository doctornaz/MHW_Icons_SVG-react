# Forked from [https://github.com/OthelloRhin/MHW_Icons_SVG].
An attempt to serve these beautiful handmade SVG icons as react components.
I'm using them for a small personal project.
Converted using SVGR

## Usage
The `individual-components` contains each icon set as different files. For example
```
/individual-react-files
|--/armor
   |--/arms
        |--Rank 1.svg
        |--Rank 2.svg
        |--Rank 3.svg
        |--Rank 4.svg
        |--Rank 5.svg
        |--Rank 6.svg
        |--Rank 7.svg
        |--Rank 8.svg
        |--Rank 9.svg
        |--Rank 10.svg
        |--Rank 11.svg
        |--Rank 12.svg
```

You can simply import them using 
```jsx
import SvgHelmRank01 from '.../route/to/svg/file'
//Rest of your code...
<SvgHelmRank01 />
```

# Support
I'll be converting more icons as needed.
Only weapons and armor for now.
